**Reflection Questions:**  
*1. What did you like about this project?*  
I have a change to create a game using JS.


*2. What did you struggle with in this project?*  
The gap in between what we learned and whats is required for this project is too big!
A lot of new concepts are introduced in this project: manipulate array
X and Y coordinates of the array are very confusing, have to trial and error to try it out.



*3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?*
